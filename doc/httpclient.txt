INTRODUCTION                                    *httpclient*

Use POSTman in Chrome or RESTClient in Firefox for hitting HTTP APIs? What about
doing it from Vim instead of your browser?

This is a cURL wrapper for Vim.

COMMANDS                                        *httpclient-commands*

                                                *httpclient-:HttpPost*
:HttpPost [url]             Send an HTTP request with the `POST` verb to the
                            given URL and pop up a window with the HTTP
                            response. The contents of the current file are used
                            as the body of the request and a `Content-Type`
                            header is added based on the filetype.


                                                *httpclient-:HttpPut*
:HttpPut [url]              Like |:HttpPost|, but send the request with the
                            `PUT` verb instead.
