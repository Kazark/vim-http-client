INTRODUCTION                                    *httpclient*

Use POSTman in Chrome or RESTClient in Firefox for hitting HTTP APIs? What about
doing it from Vim instead of your browser?

This is a cURL wrapper for Vim.

COMMANDS                                        *httpclient-commands*

                                                *httpclient-:HttpGet*
:HttpGet [url]              Send an HTTP request with the `GET` verb to the
                            given URL and pop up a window with the HTTP
                            response. 

                                                *httpclient-:HttpDelete*
:HttpDelete [url]           Like |:HttpGet|, but send the request with the
                            `DELETE` verb instead.

                                                *httpclient-:HttpPost*
:HttpPost [url]             Like |:HttpGet|, but send the request with the
                            `POST` verb instead. The contents of the current
                            file are used as the body of the request and a
                            `Content-Type` header is added based on the
                            filetype.

                                                *httpclient-:HttpPut*
:HttpPut [url]              Like |:HttpPost|, but send the request with the
                            `PUT` verb instead.
