INTRODUCTION                                    *httpclient*

Use POSTman in Chrome or RESTClient in Firefox for hitting HTTP APIs? What about
doing it from Vim instead of your browser?

COMMANDS                                        *httpclient-commands*

                                                *httpclient-:Put*
:Put [url]                  Send an HTTP request with the `PUT` verb to the
                            given URL. The contents of the current file are used
                            as the body of the request. Pop up a window with the
                            HTTP response. A `Content-Type` header is added
                            based on the filetype.
